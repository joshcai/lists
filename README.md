# lists
keeps track of different lists (learning React.js)

This is a simple app that keeps track of multiple lists using React on the front-end and Express on the back-end. 

To run the app, you will need to do the following commands (you may need to install `gulp` globally).
First, make sure you add a `config.js` file to the top level directory (follow the example of `config_example.js`). Then do:
```
npm install
gulp js
npm start
```
